# One Shots

There are lots of times when you need to repeat things. Stand up a runner, a oci-registry, a git repo, etc, etc.

The folders in this repo contain simple one-shots (bash scripts mostly and instructions) to run common day things on Ubuntu.


## List of One Shots

- **setup-github-runner**  - This sets up a simple docker container to run a github.com runner on  your local machine. This builds with the .NET deps, and in DockerInDocker mode
